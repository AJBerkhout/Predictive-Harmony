module PlayerComponent where

-- | A Halogen component which acts as a generic player for any music
-- | source that can be converted into a Melody - in other words
-- | one that is an instance of Playable

-- | When looking at the data structures, whenever we have a type variable p
-- | then look at it as if it were defined as âˆ€ p. Playable p => p
-- | It doesn't seem possible actually to define a type like this and so the
-- | Query and State data types have been parameterised with (simply) p
-- | but all functions that involve these types require the Playable constraint.
